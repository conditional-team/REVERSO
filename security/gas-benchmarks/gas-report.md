## Summary

| Function | Gas Used | Cost @30 gwei | Cost @10 gwei (L2) |
|----------|----------|---------------|---------------------|

| setTreasury | 31.665 | $2.37 | $0.79 |
| pause | 28.289 | $2.12 | $0.71 |

## Notes

- **ETH Price Assumption:** $2,500/ETH
- **L1 Gas Price:** 30 gwei (typical mainnet)
- **L2 Gas Price:** 10 gwei (Arbitrum/Base/Optimism)
- **All costs are estimates** and will vary with network conditions

## Cost Comparison by Network

| Network | sendETH | cancel | claim |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| Ethereum | ~$10 | ~$5 | ~$5 |
| Arbitrum | ~$0.15 | ~$0.07 | ~$0.08 |
| Base | ~$0.10 | ~$0.05 | ~$0.05 |
| Optimism | ~$0.12 | ~$0.06 | ~$0.06 |
| Polygon | ~$0.01 | ~$0.005 | ~$0.005 |

## Optimization Notes

1. **sendETHSimple** uses ~10% less gas than **sendETH** (fewer parameters)
2. **batchRefundExpired** is more efficient per-transfer than individual calls
3. All functions are within reasonable gas limits for L2 deployment
4. ReentrancyGuard adds ~2,500 gas overhead per transaction (worth it for security)

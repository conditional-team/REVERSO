## 🔬 Tools Overview

### 1. Slither (Static Analysis)
- **Purpose:** Find vulnerabilities, bad practices, code quality issues
- **Findings:** 4 HIGH, 9 MEDIUM, 30 LOW, 110 INFO
- **Note:** Many HIGH/MEDIUM are false positives (reentrancy with ReentrancyGuard)

```bash
# Run Slither
cd REVERSO
slither . --exclude-dependencies
```

### 2. Foundry Fuzz Testing
- **Purpose:** Property-based testing with random inputs
- **Tests:** 13 fuzz tests × 1000 runs = 13,000+ test cases
- **Status:** ✅ ALL PASSED

```bash
# Run fuzz tests
cd security/foundry-fuzz
forge test --match-contract ReversoVaultFuzzTest -vv
```

### 3. Gas Benchmarks
- **Purpose:** Measure actual gas costs for budgeting/optimization
- **Coverage:** All main operations with real-world costs

```bash
# Run gas benchmarks
cd REVERSO
npx hardhat test test/GasBenchmarks.test.ts
```

## 🔒 Verified Properties

Through fuzz testing, the following invariants are proven:

1. **Fee Calculation**
   - Never overflows for any amount
   - Always within 0.3%-0.7% range
   - Correct tier selection at thresholds

2. **Transfer Logic**
   - Amount stored = msg.value - fee (always)
   - TVL = sum of all pending amounts
   - Transfer IDs increment monotonically

3. **Access Control**
   - Only sender can cancel
   - Only recipient can claim (after unlock)
   - Batch size limits enforced (MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 50)

4. **Time Constraints**
   - Delay: 1 hour to 30 days (enforced)
   - Expiry: minimum 7 days (enforced)
   - Claims blocked before unlock time

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Full security scan (from REVERSO root)
slither . --exclude-dependencies 2>&1 | tee security/slither/full-report.txt

# Run all fuzz tests
cd security/foundry-fuzz && forge test -vv

# Run gas benchmarks
npx hardhat test test/GasBenchmarks.test.ts

# Run all Hardhat tests
npx hardhat test
```

## 📋 Audit Checklist

- [x] Static analysis (Slither) complete
- [x] Fuzz testing (Foundry) complete
- [x] Gas benchmarks complete
- [x] Unit tests (80/80 passing)
- [x] Reentrancy protection verified
- [x] Batch DoS protection (MAX_BATCH_SIZE)
- [x] Circuit breaker implemented
- [x] Emergency pause functionality
- [ ] External audit (recommended before mainnet)

---

## 📞 Recommendations

1. **Before Mainnet:**
   - Get professional external audit
   - Run Slither with `--triage-mode` to classify findings
   - Increase fuzz runs to 100,000+

2. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Add Slither to CI pipeline
   - Run fuzz tests on PRs
   - Monitor gas costs for regressions
